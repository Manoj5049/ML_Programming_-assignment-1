# Machine Learning Programming Assignment-1
* This file consists of implemention of Linear and Logistic Regression to two  different Datasets.
* Install pandas, numpy, matplot, seaborn before running the code.
* Each and every step from data processing to cross validation were performed in different cells of jupyter notebook.
* Running each and every cell gives repective output.
* Run "%matplotlib notebook" this command in seperate cell for better visualization.
## Caution: 
#### The results of logectic regression might be differnt from the one mentioned in report it is because of the usind np.random.uniform(0,1) for intializing the weights.
